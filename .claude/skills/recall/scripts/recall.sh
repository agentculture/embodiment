# recall.sh — search the shared eidetic memory store (the /recall skill).
#
# Thin, portable wrapper around `eidetic recall`. It resolves the CLI, points
# the embedding modes at the local model-gear embed gear (overridable), and
# forwards every flag verbatim — so `recall.sh "<query>" --mode hybrid --json`
# is exactly `eidetic recall "<query>" --mode hybrid --json`.
#
# The store is the files backend. Default location resolves per-operation:
# PUBLIC records inside a git repo → <repo-root>/.eidetic/memory (committed,
# team-shared); PRIVATE records, or any record outside a git repo →
# $HOME/.eidetic/memory (never committed). Recall reads both stores and merges.
# An explicit EIDETIC_DATA_DIR wins and short-circuits to that single dir.

recall.sh — search the shared eidetic memory store (the /recall skill).

Usage:
  recall.sh "<query>" [--mode exact|approximate|keyword|hybrid] [--top-k N] \
            [--alpha F] [--case-sensitive] [--filter KEY=VALUE]... \
            [--backend files|mongo|neo4j] [--scope NAME] [--visibility public|private] \
            [--json]

Modes (default: hybrid):
  exact        case-insensitive verbatim substring (--case-sensitive to tighten); offline-safe
  approximate  vector cosine / semantic similarity (uses the embed server)
  keyword      BM25 lexical; only records sharing a query term; offline-safe
  hybrid       alpha*approximate + (1-alpha)*keyword (--alpha, default 0.5);
               degrades to keyword-only when the embed server is offline

Every flag is forwarded verbatim to `eidetic recall`. See `eidetic explain recall`.

# ── default to this agent's PERSONAL, PUBLIC scope (culture.yaml `suffix`) ───
# Query this agent's OWN personal scope by default, matching where /remember
# writes, instead of the global `default` scope shared by every project on this
# host. We read the `suffix` from the nearest culture.yaml (walking up from this
# script), so the scope follows the repo identity rather than being hard-coded —
# a downstream cite-don't-import copy adapts to its own suffix, and the colleague
# backend (running in a worktree of this same repo) resolves the same suffix,
# keeping the Claude↔colleague shared-memory story intact.
#
# The personal scope is PUBLIC by default to match /remember — the memory
# scope+visibility convention (v1, docs/contract.md): a public record is
# visible to ANY query scope regardless of name (`can_serve`,
# eidetic/memory/scope.py), so a no-flag recall here returns the full public
# pool, matching both the plain `eidetic recall` CLI's own --visibility
# default and the colleague backend's runtime (colleague/memory.py hardcodes
# --visibility public). Scope and visibility are paired — the public default
# applies only when we inject the resolved scope, and only if the caller
# didn't pass --visibility (so an explicit `--visibility private` still
# wins). Passing --visibility private restores exactly what used to be the
# implicit default: this agent's own private notes (scope=<suffix>, matched
# exactly — `can_serve` only serves a private record to a query in the SAME
# scope) PLUS the full public pool (a private query still sees every public
# record too — that "private + public" merge is `can_serve`'s behavior
# whenever the QUERY itself is private, unrelated to this default). What
# changed is only the no-flag case: a plain recall now returns public-only,
# since a public-visibility query structurally excludes every private
# record regardless of scope name. An explicit --scope on the command line
# takes over steering entirely; a wheel install with no culture.yaml falls
# back to the plain CLI default (`default`/`public`).

# Default the embedding endpoint to the local model-gear embed gear. eidetic

# The endpoint is the lobes fleet gateway, which fronts every role on ONE
# OpenAI-compatible port; the per-role vLLM containers are not published to the
# host, so a per-gear port is unreachable (`lobes endpoint embedder` confirms
# the live value). eidetic-cli#28 aligned these to :8002, which matched the code
# default but was never host-reachable. These values match eidetic's own code
# default in eidetic/memory/embed.py, so this export is a redundant-but-harmless
# belt-and-suspenders default kept for explicitness and for older eidetic
# installs that predate the code-default alignment. The bearer token the gateway
# requires is read by eidetic from EIDETIC_EMBED_API_KEY / COLLEAGUE_API_KEY /
# CULTURE_VLLM_API_KEY — deliberately not set here, so no secret passes through
