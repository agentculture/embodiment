# remember.sh — ingest records into the shared eidetic memory store (the /remember skill).
#
# Thin, portable wrapper around `eidetic remember`. It resolves the CLI, points
# the embedding endpoint at the local model-gear embed gear (overridable), and
# forwards every argument verbatim. Accepts ONE record as a JSON object argument,
# or a BATCH as NDJSON on stdin (one JSON object per line) for bulk ingest.
#
#   remember.sh '{"id":"d1","text":"...","type":"docs","metadata":{...}}' --json
#   cat records.ndjson | remember.sh --json
#
# Upsert is idempotent by id (and dedups by content hash): re-remembering the
# same record updates it in place, never duplicates.
#
# The store is the files backend. Default location resolves per-operation:
# PUBLIC records inside a git repo → <repo-root>/.eidetic/memory (committed,
# team-shared); PRIVATE records, or any record outside a git repo →
# $HOME/.eidetic/memory (never committed). An explicit EIDETIC_DATA_DIR still
# wins and short-circuits to that single dir. Use --backend mongo|neo4j (with
# EIDETIC_MONGO_URI / NEO4J_URI) for a server-backed shared store.

Usage:

  cat records.ndjson | remember.sh [--json] ...

A record needs `id`, `text`, and `type`; `hash` and `metadata` are recommended
(hash is derived from text when omitted). Upsert is idempotent by id.
Records default to this agent's PERSONAL, PUBLIC scope (--scope from the
culture.yaml suffix, --visibility public); pass --visibility private to keep
a record out of the shared/committed store. Every flag is forwarded verbatim
to `eidetic remember`. See `eidetic explain remember`.

# ── default to this agent's PERSONAL, PUBLIC scope (culture.yaml `suffix`) ───
# A record this agent remembers should land in its OWN personal scope, not the
# global `default` scope shared by every project on this host. We read the
# `suffix` from the nearest culture.yaml (walking up from this script), so the
# scope follows the repo identity rather than being hard-coded — a downstream
# cite-don't-import copy adapts to its own suffix, and the colleague backend
# (running in a worktree of this same repo) resolves the same suffix, keeping
# the Claude↔colleague shared-memory story intact.
#
# The personal scope is PUBLIC by default — the memory scope+visibility
# convention (v1, docs/contract.md): an in-repo record is team-shared by
# default (routing already sends a public write inside a git repo to
# <repo-root>/.eidetic/memory, committed alongside the code), matching both
# the plain `eidetic remember` CLI's own --visibility default and the
# colleague backend's runtime (colleague/memory.py hardcodes --visibility
# public) — so a no-flag remember here and a no-flag `eidetic remember`
# elsewhere land mutually-visible records instead of silently disagreeing.
# Scope and visibility are paired — the public default applies only when we
# inject the resolved scope, and only if the caller didn't pass --visibility
# (so an explicit `--visibility private` still wins, keeping genuinely
# personal/non-shareable data out of the committed store). An explicit
# --scope on the command line takes over steering entirely; a wheel install
# with no culture.yaml falls back to the plain CLI default (`default`/`public`).
