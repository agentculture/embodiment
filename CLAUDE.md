# CLAUDE.md — seed / bootstrap placeholder

## Agent

This repository hosts the **embodiment** agent.

## Description

The agentic loop that gives an app an embodied AI presence. Install embodiment in an app or wrap one, supply a model seam plus IO callbacks, and it drives the perceive-decide-act loop and the presence pump - extracted from colleague so the loop is written once and imported, not reimplemented per host.

## Re-init instruction

This file is a seed. To expand it into your full runtime prompt:

1. Open this repo in Claude Code (or your preferred AI assistant).
2. Run `/init` — the assistant will read the repo, incorporate the description
   above, and replace this seed with a complete `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Commit the result.

Until you run `/init`, `embodiment` satisfies the `steward doctor`
`prompt-file-present` and `backend-consistency` invariants (a `CLAUDE.md`
exists and `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`) but the prompt is not
yet tailored to this agent's domain.
