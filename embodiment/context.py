"""Context-window management primitives for the agentic loop.

Provides three public functions:

- :func:`count_tokens_chars` — zero-dependency heuristic token estimator
  (characters / 4, minimum 1 when any text is present).
- :func:`window_messages` — trim a growing OpenAI-format message list to a
  token budget, preserving the system prompt and first user message, dropping
  the oldest droppable history as matched units (assistant-tool_calls +
  tool replies), inserting a single placeholder note, and keeping the most
  recent turns.
- :func:`is_context_overflow` — detect context-overflow error phrases from
  OpenAI-compatible servers via case-insensitive substring match.

All stdlib only — zero runtime dependencies.

Ported from colleague ``1.52.1``'s ``colleague/context.py`` (task t3), faithful
to the original's behaviour, signatures, and edge-case handling. The only
change is the sibling import below (``colleague.media`` → ``embodiment.media``,
the module's new home) plus this provenance note.

    - Exactly one placeholder message ``{"role":"user","content":"[earlier
